# fastent
The **fastent** Python library is a tool for end-to-end creation of **custom models for [named-entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition)**.

#### Custom Models
To train a model for a new type of entity, you just need a list of examples.

You are not limited to only predefined types like person, location and organization.

#### How It Works
fastent does end-to-end creation: **dataset generation**, **annotation**, **contextualiziation** and **training** a model.

You can also use fastent modules as standalone tools.

#### Made for Prod
fastent includes integrations with tools like spaCy, fastText pre-trained models and NLTK.

fastent is built to scale to very large text datasets in many languages.

#### Performance
How well does it work?  See the baseline performance on diverse [benchmarks](/benchmarks).

### Installation

fastent is developed for Python 3.

Clone this repo or install from PyPI:
```
pip install fastent
```

Install and set up CouchDB

For Unix systems:
```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastent/fastent/master/install.sh | bash
```

Download NLTK data:
```
python - << "EOF"
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
EOF
```

#### Downloading data files
TODO: fastText stuff

## How To

### Generation
fastent can generate a dataset from a list

TODO

fastent can even generate a list from one or two examples.
```
from fastent import dataset_pseudo_generator

model = dataset_pseudo_generator.spacy_initialize('en_core_web_lg')
dataset_pseudo_generator.dataset_generate(model,['cocaine', 'heroin'], 100)
```

The equivalent on the command line:
```
python dataset_pseudo_generator.py -m en_core_web_lg -s cocaine,heroin
```

### Annotation
TODO

### Contextualization
TODO

### Training
To train a model from the annotated and contextualized dataset:

For now the only supported learning framework is spaCy.

[Request support for a new learning framework](https://github.com/fastent/fastent/issues/new?labels=Models&title=New+learning+framework+support+request:)

TODO: sample output

### Testing
Coming soon!

## Integrations
fastent includes integrations for downloading datasets and pre-trained models.
